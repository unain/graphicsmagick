<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Future Plans</H1>
<P>A challenging release plan has been developed for Magick++. What
actually gets accomplished depends on the level of support from users
and developers. Volunteers are needed. In particular, work on the
CORBA/COM IDL-base API may proceed in parallel with other
development. The following is the tentative development and release
plan (step 1.0 is complete). 
</P>
<P><B>1.0 </B>API for operating on individual images and STL
containers of images 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This version supports all GraphicsMagick API operations
which operate on a single image as well as providing <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/">STL</A>
container support for operating on multiple images (on any STL
compatable container which supports a forward input iterator).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>STL is used as the framework in which to store images.
Template functions (e.g. montage)&nbsp; are provided to build the
image lists required by GraphicsMagick and then invoke the list-oriented
GraphicsMagick API. STL is quite powerful yet easy to use. At this stage
Magick++ has matched what is currently available/possible using the
PerlMagick API due to leveraging the power of STL.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>2.0</B> <A HREF="http://www.omg.org/">CORBA</A> and/or COM IDL
based client API with server implementation for executing image
processing operations on a remote (or local) computer. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This version provides an IDL-based API. A C++ wrapper API
compatable with that developed for release 2.0 is available for use
by clients. Client wrappers may also be developed for other languages
(e.g. Java). COM and CORBA servers are provided which  are
implemented in terms of the Magick++ API in order to satisfy client
requests (which may run a different operating system than the
server). 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>3.0</B> Integration of IDL-based API with an existing open
source work-queing system in order to load-share image processing
tasks and the image frame and file level across a large number of
machines. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This version is the culmination of the effort. By
intelligently spreading work over many machines, the performance of
GraphicsMagick is magnified. In order for this to be a success
algorithms for efficient transfer of image data must be developed.
Algorithms that take into account processor afinity and the CPU vs
I/O tradeoff for the task to be performed must be developed. At this
point in time, the queuing system to be employed has not been
identified.</BLOCKQUOTE>
