FreeType comes with two licenses from which you can choose the one which
fits your needs best:

  . The FreeType License, in file `ttf-FTL.txt'.

  . The GNU General Public License, in file `ttf-GPL.txt'.

The contributed PCF driver comes with a license similar to that of X Window
System which is compatible to the above two licenses (see file
src/pcf/readme).

There are possible patent implications.  See the file `ttf-PATENTS.txt'
for information on possible patent issues.
